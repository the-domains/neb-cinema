  For me, there are a number of reasons The Grid matters. First, using AI to
  build websites that react and adjust themselves to creators' content sounds
  suspiciously like the "genetic CMS" concept I was pushing in '08. The platform
  has nearly all the features I was after, thus saving me a world of coding
  hurt. Second, in allowing site creators to focus solely on content and
  editorial, The Grid paves the way for more inclusive business models. Design
  costs have a way of eating away at content budgets, and while small
  enterprises might benefit from good design, they often can't afford it.
  Thirdly, it's highly mobile. I now have the ability to shoot, edit, and
  publish from my cellular iPad from wherever and whenever I happen to be. Viva
  la instant gratification. :)

I'm excited. Just over a year ago, I backed a Kickstarter project with a profound goal: to democratize web design by vastly simplifying the process of building beautiful sites. At the time, I was actively into procedural design, exploring the use of algorithmic processes to produce digital media. "thegrid.io" caught my eye as a natural extension of this practice, and I signed up for the open beta as soon as able. If all goes well, this post represents my first foray into a web platform that is fundamentally different than anything before it. And that's really, really awesome. And then some.

Up to this point, I've only published sporadically, throwing out an article or two on friends' blogs, sometimes dropping a lengthy post on FB or G+. Even though I've got stuff to say, I've never felt the need to say it badly enough to roll out a blog proper. Apparently, I've been on the internet since Compuserve & AOL were _it, _designing websites since the late 90's. So, yeah, I'm a little late to the blogging game, but please don't let that get you down. There's been this concept, a particular stream-of-consciousness style of publication, floating in the back of my head. A sort of accidental photojournalism. This blog is a first stab. I think.

Thank you for joining me for the ride. Hopefully I'll see you around.
