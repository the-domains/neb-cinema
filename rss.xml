            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>001 : Letter from the Editor</h1><p>For me, there are a number of reasons The Grid matters. First, using AI to build websites that react and adjust themselves to creators' content sounds suspiciously like the "genetic CMS" concept I was pushing in '08. The platform has nearly all the features I was after, thus saving me a world of coding hurt. Second, in allowing site creators to focus solely on content and editorial, The Grid paves the way for more inclusive business models. Design costs have a way of eating away at content budgets, and while small enterprises might benefit from good design, they often can't afford it. Thirdly, it's highly mobile. I now have the ability to shoot, edit, and publish from my cellular iPad from wherever and whenever I happen to be. Viva la instant gratification. :)</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/75da3fc0e973a8a317d515f8304dc2b4045e053e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
